## Abstract:
Neuroscientists rely on distributed spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity to understand how neural units contribute to cognitive functions and behavior. However, the extent to which neural activity reliably indicates a unit's causal contribution to the behavior is not well understood. To address this issue, we provide a systematic multi-site perturbation framework that captures time-varying causal contributions of elements to a collectively produced outcome. Applying our framework to intuitive toy examples and artificial neural networks revealed that recorded activity patterns of neural elements may not be generally informative of their causal contribution due to activity transformations within a network. Overall, our findings emphasize the limitations of inferring causal mechanisms from neural activities and offer a rigorous lesioning framework for elucidating causal neural contributions.
